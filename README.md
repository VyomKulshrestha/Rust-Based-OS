# HelioxOS

A minimal modular Rust-based operating system designed as the long-term
foundation for an AI-native autonomous computing environment.

HelioxOS keeps the kernel deterministic, lightweight, and independent from
probabilistic AI systems. AI inference, semantic memory, vector databases, and
agent orchestration belong in runtime services above the kernel, not in the
kernel core.

## Current Status

Version 0.1.0 provides a bootable x86_64 Rust kernel foundation with:

- Bootloader integration through `bootloader`
- VGA text output and UART serial logging
- GDT, IDT, CPU exception handlers, PIC timer and keyboard IRQs
- Page-table setup, boot-info frame allocation, and a 256 KiB kernel heap
- Cooperative task scheduler with task state and priority metadata
- Interactive shell with inspection and management commands
- Volatile in-memory RAM filesystem
- Capability registry and caller-held capability authorization helpers
- Audit logging hooks for security and lifecycle events
- Modular service manager for runtime service registration
- Deterministic IPC message contracts for future runtime services
- Syscall ABI skeleton for future userspace processes
- `agentd` runtime boundary stub for future Heliox agent integration

## Architecture

+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Agent Layer (future)                                    |
| Autonomous workflows, planning, verification             |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

| Runtime Layer                                           |
| Services, permissions, IPC, AI orchestration boundaries  |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Kernel Layer                                            |
| Boot, memory, interrupts, scheduling, isolation, HAL     |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

The existing Python Heliox desktop agent can be treated as a future runtime or
agent-layer service. Its voice, gesture, local LLM, and autonomous task
execution logic should remain outside the kernel and communicate through
capability-checked runtime interfaces.

## Build

Prerequisites:

- Rust nightly through rustup
- `x86_64-unknown-none` target
- `bootimage`
- QEMU for local boot testing

```powershell
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none --toolchain nightly
cargo install bootimage

.\build.ps1 check
.\build.ps1 build
```

The boot image is created at:

```text
target\x86_64-unknown-none\debug\bootimage-helioxos.bin
```

To run after installing QEMU:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 run
```

## Development Priorities

1. Bootloader and kernel initialization
2. Memory management and interrupts
3. Scheduler and shell
4. Filesystem and isolation
5. Modular runtime services
6. Security and sandboxing

## Agent Integration Path

The current `agentd` service is a deterministic boundary, not the full AI
agent. It lets HelioxOS start a sandboxed service and pass bounded IPC messages
through capability checks.

Try it in QEMU:

```text
agent status
agent start
agent send ping
agent status
ipc
syscalls
```

Future work should attach the real Heliox agent above this boundary:

1. Add real userspace process loading.
2. Implement syscall entry from ring 3.
3. Move runtime services out of kernel modules.
4. Port or host the Heliox planner, orchestrator, verifier, sandbox, memory,
   and plugins as userspace services.
5. Add device drivers for audio, camera, display, input, storage, and network
   before enabling voice, gesture, screen vision, or desktop control.

## Design Rules

- Keep the kernel deterministic.
- Keep AI, semantic memory, and vector search outside kernel space.
- Prefer capability-checked service boundaries over global authority.
- Use Rust safety by default; keep unsafe blocks small and documented.
- Treat runtime services as replaceable modules.
- Favor maintainability over feature quantity in v1.
